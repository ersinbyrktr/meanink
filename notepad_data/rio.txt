Title: Rhythms of Rio

December 15th, 2023

Olá from Rio de Janeiro! This city is bursting with color, music, and life. The moment we arrived, I could hear the distant sound of samba drums.

Our first adventure was visiting Christ the Redeemer atop Mount Corcovado. We took a tram up the mountain through the Tijuca Forest, which is so lush and green. The statue itself is immense and seems to watch over the entire city. From up there, the view of Rio is breathtaking—the beaches, the cityscape, the mountains.

Next, we headed to Copacabana Beach. The sand is soft and the water warm. People were playing beach volleyball and soccer everywhere. We joined a game for a bit, even though I'm not very good—I mostly just laughed and tried not to embarrass myself too much.

For lunch, we tried feijoada, a black bean stew with pork, which is a traditional Brazilian dish. It was hearty and delicious. Fresh tropical fruits here are amazing—the mangoes and papayas are so sweet.

In the afternoon, we explored the Selarón Steps in the Lapa neighborhood. The stairs are covered in colorful tiles from all over the world. The artist, Jorge Selarón, started it as a tribute to the Brazilian people. I found tiles from places I recognized and others I'd love to visit someday.

We visited a samba school in preparation for Carnival. Even though it's a few months away, the rehearsals are in full swing. The music is infectious—I couldn't help but dance along. The costumes are so elaborate and beautiful; I tried on a headdress that was almost bigger than me!

As the sun set, we took a cable car up to Sugarloaf Mountain. Watching the sunset from there was magical—the sky turned shades of pink and purple, and the city lights started to twinkle below.

In the evening, we went to a street fair where there was live music and dancing. I tried to learn some samba steps—let's just say I need more practice! Everyone was so friendly and full of joy.

Rio has a spirit that's hard to put into words. It's vibrant and alive, and the people have such a zest for life. I'm falling in love with this place more every minute.
