Title: Bonjour, Paris!

April 12th, 2023

I can't believe I'm actually here—Paris, the city I've dreamed about for as long as I can remember! The moment we stepped off the plane, I was hit by a whirlwind of excitement. The air feels different here, like it's filled with a kind of magic.

Our first stop was, of course, the Eiffel Tower. Seeing it in pictures is one thing, but standing beneath it is something else entirely. It's massive and elegant all at once. We took the elevator to the top, and the view was breathtaking. The entire city sprawled out beneath us like a living tapestry. I tried to spot all the places I want to visit—the Louvre, Notre-Dame, Montmartre.

We spent the afternoon wandering along the Seine River. Street artists were everywhere, their paintings capturing the essence of the city. I bought a small watercolor of the Notre-Dame to hang in my room back home. We sat at a little café and had croissants and hot chocolate. I attempted to order in French, and the waiter smiled, which I hope means I didn't butcher the language too badly.

The Louvre was next on our list. It's so huge! I think you could spend a week there and not see everything. We made sure to see the Mona Lisa. I'll be honest, it was smaller than I expected, but there's something captivating about her smile. I found myself wondering what she was thinking.

In the evening, we went to Montmartre. The cobblestone streets and old buildings made me feel like I'd stepped back in time. Musicians played on the corners, and the scent of fresh crepes filled the air. I tried one with Nutella and bananas—so delicious!

Before heading back to the hotel, we stopped by a bookstore called Shakespeare and Company. It's the coziest place, filled floor to ceiling with books. I could spend hours there. I picked up a collection of French poetry; maybe it'll help me improve my language skills.

As I crawl into bed, I can't help but feel incredibly lucky. Paris is everything I hoped it would be and more. I can't wait to see what tomorrow brings!
